# PyLiesDisguised

This poem is comprised of three components:
- an input: `disguise.txt`
    - The input file, written in unicode text, is meant to be read by
      humans.  However, it also contains specific whitespace characters,
      which carry special meaning to the algorithm, despite being
      otherwise invisible to the human eye.
- an algorithm: `lies.py`
    - The algorithm, written in Python, is meant to be read by machines.
      Conversely, it uses specially constructed syntax which allows it
      be read as poetry by a human user.
- an output: `eyes.txt`
    - Feeding the input file into the algorithm produces an output file which
      while plaintext, can be viewed as a relevant piece of ASCII art.

These three parts fit together in both form and function, mechanically
and metaphysically.
